# Optimized Algorithm
This is a repersotory, where some optimized algorithms will be implemented

Optimized algorithms which will already implemented are:

# Sorted Balanced 
see [Approximation Algorithms (Load Balancing)](https://www.sfu.ca/~arashr/lecture24.pdf) for more information about the algorithm.

The Load Balancing problem is [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness).

# Dcp Balanced

This is a ameliored version of the Sorted Balanced Algorithm.
More about the description of the algorithm later.
